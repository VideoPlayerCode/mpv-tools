## Script Configurations

This folder contains example configuration files. To enable them on your own
system, simply create the `script-opts/` folder in your mpv config path,
exactly as shown here (side by side with your `scripts/` folder).

The configurations automatically follow the `<current script name>.conf` format,
so if you've renamed any of the scripts after downloading them, you'll also have
to rename their configuration files to match the new name that you've given the
scripts.

To enable any of these example configurations, simply rename the demo extensions
from `.conf.example` to `.conf`.
